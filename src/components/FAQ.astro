        <summary class="cursor-pointer font-semibold text-lg">Are you a travel agency? Do you offer full Umrah packages?</summary>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">
          No, we are not a travel agency. We specialize in on-the-ground support services in Makkah. You handle visas, flights, and group marketing – we manage hotels, meals, and transport locally.
